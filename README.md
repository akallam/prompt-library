# prompt-library
A centralized library of AI prompts for various models and tasks. Organize, share, and reuse your best prompts.

## Directory Structure

### ðŸ“‹ `/instructions/`
This folder is used to store specific instructions for any prompt file to reference. For example, it could contain coding standards to follow that will be referenced in a prompt file, style guidelines, formatting requirements, or other detailed specifications that prompts can incorporate by reference.

### ðŸŽ¯ `/prompts/`
The main collection of AI prompts organized by category and use case. This is the core directory containing all prompt files.

- **`prompt-template.md`** - A standardized template for creating new prompts. Use this as a starting point when developing new prompts to ensure consistency across the library.

#### Subdirectories:

- **`/prompts/archived/`** - Previously used prompts that are no longer active but kept for reference and historical purposes.

- **`/prompts/experimental/`** - Work-in-progress and experimental prompts being tested or developed. These may not be fully refined or ready for production use.

- **`/prompts/personal/`** - Personal prompts for individual use cases, hobbies, and personal projects. Examples include fitness trainers, personal assistants, and lifestyle-related prompts.

- **`/prompts/professional/`** - Business and work-related prompts for professional use cases, including project management, technical documentation, code review, and workplace communication.
